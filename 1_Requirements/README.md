## Requirements
## Introduction
Wiper system is the utility project. It is used to clean the wind shield of the car at the front and rear. Wiper works by removing oil,dust,rain water and dirt.That get struck to the wind shield and the arm is provided by the motor.The warm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move. now a days we have an automatic wiper control when ever we stop wiping in between the process it will automatically comes to initial position this is the new wiper system as behined in the wiper arm.
## 4W'S and 1H
## Where :
* It is attached to moveable arms on the outside of the wind shield.
* It is connected to a motor that controls the wipers.
## Why :
* The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the wind screen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all the times.
## When :
* The main purpose is to be clear away from rain and snow from the windshield. While the headlights help you see better at night.
## What :
* The main purpose is to clean the windshield of the car at he front and rear. In some cars we have wipers on the rear side.
## How :
* The main purpose is to be operated by an electric motor which is attached to a worm gear.
* It transmits the necessa4ry force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
## Strength
* Decreases the environmental pollution.
* Decreases the fuel consumption.
* Increase safety.
* Capacityincreases under shot gaps.
* Smootness trafic flow.
## Weekness
* Limited speed.
* Capacity decreases under conservactive gaps.
* cost is high.
* Maintaince problem.
* can be frustrating at low penetration rates.
## opportunities
* Technology maturity may reduce system cost.
* Enables novel MTM applications.
* Technology maturity may reduce system cost.
## Threats
* User acceptance in terms of both purchase intention and frequent activation after purchase.
* cost.
* MTM delayed adaptation.
## High Level Requirements
| HLR | Description |
|---- | ---------- |
| HLR_1 | Hardware materials |
| HLR_2 | System control should be proper condition |
| HLR_3 | Wind shield should have connectors |
| HLR_4 | It requires missionary conditions |

## Low Level Requirements
| LLR | Description |
|-----| ----------- |
| LLR_1 | High maintaince is required |
| LLR_2 | It consumes more battery |
| LLR_3 | When antifreeze washer fluid is used, it can help the wipers |
| LLR_4 | System should work thoroughly |
